## Introduction to Openmp

Openmp stands for Open Multi-Processing. It is a programming interface that allows one to run code with compiler directives in order to reduce the processing time. Instead of running code through one processor, code can be run on multiple processors, i.e. 2,4,8 depending on the number of processors your computer has. 

You can see throughout this manual there are several routines that are coded sequentially and using openmp. There is a comparison for each of these routines to show the amount of computing time saved.
